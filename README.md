Using natural language processing to build a spam filter for text messages

We have a collection of text data known as a corpus. Specifically, there are 5,572 SMS messages written in English, serving as training examples. The first column is the SMS message itself stored as a string and The second column is target variable containing the class labels, which tells us if the message is spam or ham (aka not spam).

Since the target variable contains discrete values, this is a classification task.
